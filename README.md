<h1>Prepare Data for Looker Dashboards and Reports</h1>

This project showcases a data visualization challenge lab completed after taking the google cloud course "Prepare Data for Looker Dashboards and Reports". The objective was to analyze FAA datasets and create interactive dashboards to help a private plane and helicopter rental company determine optimal rental hub locations.  

**The challenge required:**  
 Creating multiple **Looks** (custom visualizations) to answer key business questions  
 **Merging datasets** from Flights and Airports for enhanced insights  
 **Building a dashboard** to present all visualizations in an interactive format  

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

 **Looker (Google Cloud)**  
 **SQL (Custom Measures, Table Calculations)**  
 **Data Visualization (Tables, Bar Charts, Pivot Tables)**

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>üñ• Google Cloud Platform (Looker Instance - Temporary Credentials)

</b> 

<h2>Tasks and Visualizations:</h2>

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Most Heliports by State**  
 **Objective:** Identify the top 10 states and cities with the highest number of heliports  
 **Dataset:** Airports  
 **Data used:** Airports Count, Airports State, Airports City  
 **Process:** I filterd the facility type dimension, selected heliport and limited to 10  
 **Final output:** Table visualization in descending order

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Facility Type Breakdown for Top States**  
 **Objective:** Analyze facility type distribution in states with the most airports  
 **Dataset:** Airports  
 **Data used:** Airports Count, Airports State, Airports Facility Type  
 **Process:** I Pivoted the facility type dimension to show the distribution   
 **Final output:** Table visualization in descending order

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Highest Flight Cancellation Rates**  
 **Objective:** Identify airports and states with the highest percentage of flight cancellations (with over 10,000 flights)  
 **Dataset:** Flights  
 **Data used:** Aircraft Origin City, Aircraft Origin State, Percentage of Flights Cancelled, Flights Count, Flights Details Cancelled Count   
 **Process:** I filtered for flights exceeding 10,000, then created a table calculation to determine the cancellation percentage   
 **Final output:** Table visualization in descending order with Flight count and Flight Details Cancelled Count made invisible

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Smallest Average Distance Between Airports**  
 **Objective:** Determine the origin and destination airports with the smallest average flight distance  
 **Dataset:** Flights  
 **Data used:** Flights Origin and Destination, Average Distance (Miles)  
 **Process:** Created a custom measure to calculate the average flight distance, applied a filter to remove zero values   
 **Final output:** Table visualization in ascending order

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Busiest Major Joint-Use Airports with Control Towers**  
 **Objective:** Identify the busiest airports that are major, joint-use, and have control towers  
 **Dataset:** Flights & Airports (Merged)  
 **Data used:** Aircraft origin City, Airports City, Aircraft Origin State, Airports state, Aircraft origin code, Airports Code  
 **Process:** Merged the Flights and Airports datasets, filtering for airports marked as major, joint-use, and with control towers, then visualized the busiest ones   
 **Final output:** Bar chart visualization

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard: Consolidated Insights**  
 **Objective:** Combine all visualizations into a single interactive dashboard for presentation  
 **Dataset:** Airports, Flights  
 **Process:** Added all created Looks and the merged results visualization to a new dashboard, organizing them for easy navigation and insights.  
 **Final output:** Interactive dashboard with all visualizations
