<h1>Prepare Data for Looker Dashboards and Reports</h1>

This project showcases a data visualization challenge lab completed after taking the google cloud course "Prepare Data for Looker Dashboards and Reports". The objective was to analyze FAA datasets and create interactive dashboards to help a private plane and helicopter rental company determine optimal rental hub locations.  

**The challenge required:**  
âœ… Creating multiple **Looks** (custom visualizations) to answer key business questions  
âœ… **Merging datasets** from Flights and Airports for enhanced insights  
âœ… **Building a dashboard** to present all visualizations in an interactive format  

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

âœ… **Looker (Google Cloud)**  
âœ… **SQL (Custom Measures, Table Calculations)**  
âœ… **Data Visualization (Tables, Bar Charts, Pivot Tables)**

<h2>Environments Used </h2>
